# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element is a separate object, called a node, that contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

This section covers the implementation of singly linked lists, including basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

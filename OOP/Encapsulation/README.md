# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. It involves bundling the data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. This allows the internal state of an object to be hidden from the outside world and only accessible through public methods.

In this section, we will look at basic encapsulation using getters and setters.

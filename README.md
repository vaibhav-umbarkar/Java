# Java Placement Preparation Repository

This repository is dedicated to helping you master key concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Java, with a special focus on placement preparation.

## Contents

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

Each algorithm is implemented with detailed comments to help you understand the logic and flow, preparing you for coding interviews and technical rounds.

### 2. Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

These searching techniques are crucial for problem-solving in interviews and are implemented with a focus on time and space complexity.

### 3. Exception Handling in Java
- **Try-Catch-Finally**
- **Throw vs Throws**
- **Custom Exceptions**

Proper error handling is a key skill in software development. This section covers the fundamentals of managing exceptions, helping you write robust and error-free code.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**

These OOP concepts are essential for designing scalable and maintainable software and are frequently tested in technical interviews.
